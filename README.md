My Portfolio Page:

This is an initial design for my GitHub portfolio, including an about me page, a portfolio page, and a contact page.
The page is not yet functional beyond basic links to these three pages, but should be ready to grow as I add functionality and new projects.

The deisgn makes use of responsive elements and functions on both desktop and mobile devices while maintaining the integrity of the elements.
